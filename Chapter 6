   1) "99 bottles of beer on the wall..." Write a program which prints out the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite
   : "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
   #use a loop method
   number = 99
    while number > 0 do
    puts "#{number} bottles of beer on the wall, #{number} bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around, #{(number) -1} 
    bottles of beer on the wall."
    number = number - 1
   end
   
   2) Write a Deaf Grandma program. Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with 
   HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!, unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) 
   and yells back, NO, NOT SINCE 1938! 
      #STAGE ONE - basic program - have to put NOT upcase, if put == downcase - will think capitalised words are correct for response
             
             puts "Ask Grandma a question"
              says = gets.chomp
              if says != says.upcase
              puts "HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!"
            else
              puts "NO, NOT SINCE 1938!"
             end
   
   To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time; 
   maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950. 
   #STAGE 2 - Change year  to a random number between 1930 and 1950. 
              
              puts "Ask Grandma a question"
              says = gets.chomp
              if says == says.downcase
              puts "HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!"
              else
              puts "NO, NOT SINCE #{rand(1930..1950)}!"
              end
   
   You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE. #have used an until loop
  
      puts "Ask grandma something"
      says = gets.chomp
      until says == "BYE" do
      if says != says.upcase
      puts "HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!"
      else
      puts "NO, NOT SINCE #{rand(1930..1950)}!"
      end
      puts "Ask grandma something"
      says = gets.chomp
      end
      #gradnma says goodbye
      puts "GOODBYE DEARIE"
    
   3) Extend your Deaf Grandma program: What if grandma doesn't want you to leave? When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you. 
   Change your previous program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row. Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE 
   three times, but not in a row, you should still be talking to grandma.
   #Cannot just change "BYE" to "BYE BYE BYE" b/c more than three BYEs in a row will continue grandma loop.
   
   puts "Ask grandma something"
   says = gets.chomp
   bye = "BYE BYE BYE"
   until says.include? bye do
   if says != says.upcase
   puts "HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!"
   else
   puts "NO, NOT SINCE #{rand(1930..1950)}!"
   end
   puts "Ask grandma something"
   says = gets.chomp
   end
  puts "GOODBYE DEARIE"
   
   4)Leap Years. Write a program which will ask for a starting year and an ending year, and then puts all of the leap years between
   them (and including them, if they are also leap years). Leap years are years divisible by four (like 1984 and 2004). However,
   years divisible by 100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) unless they are divisible by 400 (like 1600 and 2000, which
   were in fact leap years). 
   #remember to put input to integers
   
   puts "Please enter a starting year: "
   starting_year = gets.chomp.to_i
   puts "Please enter an ending year: "
   ending_year = gets.chomp.to_i

  year_array = (starting_year .. ending_year).to_a
  year_array.delete_if {|x| (x%4 != 0) || ((x% 100 == 0) && (x% 400 !=0))}
