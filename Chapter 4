1) Write a program which asks for a person's first name, then middle, then last. Finally, it should greet the person using their full name.
    puts "What is your first name?"
      first_name = gets.chomp
    puts "What is your middle name?"
      middle_name = gets.chomp
    puts "what is your last name?"
      last_name = gets.chomp
    puts "Hello #{first_name} #{middle_name} #{last_name}!"
    
2) Write a program which asks for a person's favorite number. Have your program add one to the number,
then suggest the result as a bigger and better favorite number. (Do be tactful about it, though.)
    puts "What is your favourite number?"
    favourite_number = gets.chomp
    puts "Maybe #{(favourite_number).to_i + 1} would be a better favourite number?"
