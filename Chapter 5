   1) Write an Angry Boss program. It should rudely ask what you want. Whatever you answer, the Angry Boss should yell it back to you, 
   and then fire you. For example, if you type in I want a raise., it should yell back WHADDAYA MEAN "I WANT A RAISE."?!?  YOU'RE FIRED!!
   
      puts "What do YOU want?"
      answer = gets.chomp.upcase
      puts "WHADDAYA MEAN \"#{answer}.\"?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!"

    2) Write a program which will display a Table of Contents so that it looks like this:

                    Table of Contents                
                                                     
    Chapter 1:  Numbers                        page 1
    Chapter 2:  Letters                       page 72
    Chapter 3:  Variables                    page 118
    
    solution: 
    #set line width
    line_width = 50
    #center title
    puts "Table of Contents".center line_width
    #puts empty line between title and contents
    puts " "
    puts "Chapter 1:  Numbers".ljust(line_width/2) + "Page 1".rjust(line_width/2)
    puts "Chapter 2:  Letters".ljust(line_width/2) + "Page 72".rjust(line_width/2)
    puts "Chapter 3:  Variables".ljust(line_width/2) + "Page 118".rjust(line_width/2)
