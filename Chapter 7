1) write a program which asks us to type in as many words as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter
on an empty line), and which then repeats the words back to us in alphabetical order.
    
2) Write the program we talked about at the very beginning of this chapter.
    Hint: There's a lovely array method which will give you a sorted version of an array: sort. Use it!
    
3)Try writing the above program without using the sort method. 
    
4) Rewrite your Table of Contents program. Start the program with an array holding all of the information for your Table of Contents 
(chapter names, page numbers, etc.). Then print out the information from the array in a beautifully formatted Table of Contents.
