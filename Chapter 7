1) Write a program which asks us to type in as many words as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter
on an empty line), and which then repeats the words back to us in alphabetical order.

puts "Type in as many words as you like, each on a new line. The input will stop when you press enter on an empty line."
words_array = []
#have to have an initial value for input or it won't work as input has not yet been defined in first step of while loop below
input = nil
while input != ""
input = gets.chomp.downcase
words_array.push input
end

puts words_array.sort

    
2)Try writing the above program without using the sort method. - still working on this one...
    
3) Rewrite your Table of Contents program. Start the program with an array holding all of the information for your Table of Contents 
(chapter names, page numbers, etc.). Then print out the information from the array in a beautifully formatted Table of Contents.

#just put 25 as half of linewidth to simplify. Would need to puts title separately before table_of_contents
table_of_contents = [["Chapter 1: Numbers", "page 1"], ["Chapter 2: Letters", "page 72"], ["Chapter 3: Variables", "page 118"]]

table_of_contents.each {|x,y| puts x.ljust(25) + y.rjust(25)}
